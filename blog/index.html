        In this page I'll post progress updates on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-WEGni3sqwCeM5EgDXjLDKuamhUgZ2ePhFU48XKqFiM">Google Docs</a> and this website, as well as maybe make posts about interesting things I find while learning Polish, or other materials different to Duolingo.

        I plan on making blog posts and linking them here later. <!-- I think my first one will be about the time I learned a lot of Polish just by hanging out with my girlfriend's parents. -->

                I'm making more and more progress to get this website up to date with the Google Docs. Today I finished uploading all the lessons before the Checkpoint 2 on Duolingo! The lessons in the Google Docs are still at the same place than before.

                This website is looking more and more complete! Today I uploaded all of the lessons before Checkpoint 1 on Duolingo. The lessons in the Google Docs are complete until Household items, past Checkpoint 2.

                I've been busy with my PhD and lots is going on with my mental health recently, but I got a breather and finally updated and added what I was still studying, which was the Time and Household lessons. I have also decided to make this a website instead of a Google Docs, now that it's getting long and slow to update. It's not ready yet, but soon I'll replace it with the website version. Looking forward to it!

                I finished the Colors lesson! It also touches on Genitive plural of nouns and adjectives, so check it out. <a href="/lessons/checkpoint_2/17_5_extra_1.html">I also added an extra lesson </a>(not in duolingo) based on stuff I got from listening to songs in Polish<. Also, I changed the icon for Neuter nouns so that you can copy paste the icon and search for all the neuter nouns easier (only doable with male and female nouns before). Next is questions and oh boy... there's a lot to unpack.

                I added the Negation lesson, which also adds the genitive demonstrative pronouns.

                I forgot all about demonstrative pronouns in plural! So now I added them, plus I continued on to the Clothing section. I'm not sure if I'm done with it yet or not. I added a few references to genders (Masculine personal, non-masculine personal, etc.) at the beginning of the first lessons to help with people searching things in the dictionary.

                I finally finished the Plurals section! I added the Instrumental case for Plurals, and I also realized while doing this, that I never formally introduced the Nominative case in singulars, so I modified the first lesson grammar section to include it. Because nominative is the "default", I think I overlooked it when taking notes.

                I finally uploaded the Plurals! Although only Nominative and Accusative. I was very busy since last time and it was difficult from a couple of new concepts like the Masculine personal and Non-masculine personal. I think following this, I will have a chance to follow up with the next lessons faster, hopefully. Next I will add a section on Instrumental case for plural.
